    "description": "Welcome to Paris THC Tours—where history, art, and a cannabis-friendly spirit come together for an unforgettable 3-hour journey through the heart of Paris. Our motto is simple: explore the city, enjoy responsibly, and learn from local experts. We're passionate about Paris's cafés, cafés-crèmes, and cobblestone streets—plus the unique subculture that embraces cannabis tourism in a safe, discreet, and entirely legal way.\nOur founders, Lee and Charlie, are seasoned Paris residents who share a deep love for both the city's renowned landmarks and its emerging 420-friendly scene. We do not sell cannabis directly; instead, we offer carefully curated stop-offs at trusted local boutiques, private lounges, or CBD shops, along with expert guidance on how to stay within France's legal guidelines.",
